# dmenu_mpc

Control `mpc` via `dmenu`.

## Coverage

Although the complete list of `mpc` commands are listed, `dmenu_mpc` only
implements the following `mpc` commands:

* `playlist`: present the current playlist in `dmenu` and play the chosen song

Other, non-interactive commands (such as `stop`, `toggle`, `crop` etc.) work as
intended.
